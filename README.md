# Counter Down

I have developed this on Introduction to JavaScript's lesson by DIO. First of all we just had to make a screen with two buttons, one to increment the value an another one to decrement. I have decided to these sum/subtract buttons to make a timer. I've tried to add a button "continue", in order to keep counting down, but, unfortunately, i couldn`d make it yet.
